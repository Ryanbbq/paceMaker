# CST 438 Project 1
# Recipe Vision

## Heroku Deployed 
https://pacemaker438.herokuapp.com/

## Team
Brian Little, Monique LaCroix, Ryan Lebon, Kristine Yvonne Laranjo

## Important Notes
1. The login feature is still in the works and one should not use a real password when signing up. It is not required to be logged in in order to use the main features. 
2. We recommend logging in with these variables: (you may have to click login twice)
    1. username: **teacher** 
    2. password: **123**
3. We originally considered using the Facebook API for login, but decided to not go in that direction.
4. **The database is able to store users. Please do not use real passwords if you decide to create an account**
5. The 3 APIs: Youtube, Google Vision, and Edamam are all functional
6. The commit frequency is not correct and alot of the Lines of Code are from a ui template called semantic that I ended up not using and it caused my app to crash when I would try to deploy it to heroku
