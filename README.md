## Important Notes
1. The login feature is extremely buggy, and one should not use a real password when signing up. It is required to be logged in in order to use the features. 
2. We recommend logging in with these variables
    1. username: **teacher** 
    2. password: **123**
3. We decided not to include the Facebook API for login.
4. The database is able to store users, but unable to save recipes for a user.
5. The 3 APIs: Youtube, Google Vision, and Edamam are all functional
